## Abstract
This projects goal is to follow a selected individual and follow them at a set distance. Once that individual makes a certain gesture (in this case a fist), the robot starts a countdown of 3 seconds and takes a picture. This picture is then saved to a local folder until it can upload the image to a google drive.

This project uses RoboFlow and Depthai for person detection, person following, and gesture identification. It also utilizes Google Cloud Console to create an application to create an application to upload pictures to the project's Google Drive. 

## What We Promised
### Must Have
- Detect a person and follow them at a set distance
- Detect the appropriate gesture and take a picture
- Upload picture to Google Drive

### Nice to Have
- Focus only on the closest person
- Have multiple gestures, one to stop and one to go

## Accomplishments
- Person Detection and Following
	- We were able to create a Depthai model that first finds a person and follows behind them at a set distance of 1 meter.
- Gesture Detection
	- We were able to set up a gesture detection model that could identify rock, paper, and scissors.
	- We were able to use the rock gesture to take pictures.
- Picture Upload
	- We were able to integrate a data upload node that continually verifies the internet connection then uploads the taken pictures to google drive.

## Challenges
- We were having a hard time getting the camera to only focus on one person, as it would rather identify all people and move to the center of them.
- The gesture detection node and the person detection node would try to use the same camera, requiring us to launch the nodes separately.
- The google projects token would expire every hour, resulting in us having to manually create a new token every hour.

## Running the Repository
If you are interested in reproducing our project, here are a few steps to get you started with our repo:

1.  Follow instuctions on  [UCSD Robocar Framework Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YS5YGbo8evIo9Mlb0J-w2r3bZfju37Zl4UmdaN2CD2A/),  
    pull  `devel`  image on your JTN:  `docker pull djnighti/ucsd_robocar:devel`
2.  `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`  
    (make sure you upgrade the packages, or else it won't work; maybe helpful if you run into some error  [https://askubuntu.com/questions/1433368/how-to-solve-gpg-error-with-packages-microsoft-com-pubkey](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1433368/how-to-solve-gpg-error-with-packages-microsoft-com-pubkey))  
    check if  `slam_toolbox`  is installed and launchable:  
    
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-slam-toolbox
    source_ros2
    ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py
    
    Output should be similar to:
    ```
    [INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /root/.ros/log/2024-03-16-03-57-52-728234-ucsdrobocar-148-07-14151
    [INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO
    [INFO] [async_slam_toolbox_node-1]: process started with pid [14173]

3.  Since we upgrade all existing packges, we need to rebuild VESC pkg under  `/home/projects/sensor2_ws/src/vesc/src/vesc`  
 ``` {
    cd /home/projects/sensor2_ws/src/vesc/src/vesc
    git pull
    git switch foxy
   ```
    
   make sure you are on foxy branch  
    
   Then, build 1st time under  `sensor2_ws/src/vesc/src/vesc`  
    
 ```
	colcon build
    source install/setup.bash
```
    
   Then, 2nd time but under  `sensor2_ws/src/vesc`  
```
    cd /home/projects/sensor2_ws/src/vesc
    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash
 ```
  Now, try  `ros2 pkg xml vesc`, check if VESC pkg version has come to  `1.2.0`  
    
4.  Install  **Navigation 2**  package, and related packages:  
    `sudo apt install ros-foxy-navigation2 ros-foxy-nav2* ros-foxy-robot-state-publisher ros-foxy-joint-state-publisher`
5. Pull this repository
```
cd /home/projects/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/UCSD-ECEMAE-148/fall-2024-final-project-team-15/tree/main
cd final_project/
 ```
6. Create a Google cloud console account. Once you have an account, create a project.  
	-  Enable the Google Drive API:
	    -  In the API & Services section, click Library.
	    -  Search for "Google Drive API".
	    -  Select it and click Enable.
	 - Create Credentials
		 - Navigate to API & Services > Credentials.
	- Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
		- Click on Create Credentials â†’ OAuth client ID.
	    -   If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen:
        -   Application name: Enter a name (e.g., `ROS2 Drive App`).
        -   Add any necessary information and save.
	    -   For Application type, choose Desktop app.
	    -  Name the OAuth client (e.g., `data_uploader`) and click Create.
7. Download Credentials and upload it to the drive.
	    -   After creating the credentials, click Download JSON to save the file and name it `creds.json`.
	    -   Keep this file secure as it contains sensitive information.
8. Install the necessary requirements:
	 ``pip install google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2``
9.  Remove the placeholder `token.JSON` and run `authenticate.py`.
10. Run the software using 
`ros2 launch final_project_pkg person_follower_pkg_launch.launch.py`
